The struggle of custom software on modern mobile phones
=======================================================

Subtitle
--------

The Myth Of Open Consumer Hardware

Abstract
--------

Will will take a brief look at the situation at current mobile smartphones support in FOSS software. The central point will be the FreeSmartphone middleware and the Palm Pre device. We will outline which steps are needed to get phone like the Palm Pre working with FOSS software only.

Description
-----------

Many people are talking about it, however only few people really know how open today's smartphones are in reality. This talk will give you an overview about how much effort it is to port an open source middleware (namely the freesmartphone.org middleware) to a recent smartphone. It's not about developing user interfaces, but rather the level between the UI and the Linux kernel.

We will outline the necessary steps, their complexity and all the problems you will encounter on the way. As primary example we will take the Pre smartphone from HP|Palm which is driven by WebOS. Neither Android nor Maemo|Meego have improved the situation much. We will show you the nightmares we had with porting free software to the HTC Dream and the Nokia N900.

In detail we will focus mostly on the communication with the internal modem of the device, as this often is the biggest problem on these devices. There are proprietary protocols which have been painfully reverse engineered over a long time, especially for the Palm Pre device. We will describe the steps we have done to get the lower level and higher level bits of the protocol running with free and open source software.

Openmoko: 5 years after. What's left behind
===========================================

Subtitle
--------

Free software and hardware projects for mobile communication.

Abstract
--------

A brief look at the history of the Openmoko project, what lead to its (perceived) failure, and why even despite that it was very valuable for the free and open source community. We're then discussing at what's left behind and what the future holds.

Description
-----------

The Openmoko project has been announced November 2006 on the Open Source in Mobile conference in Amsterdam. Back then no one knew about neither Android nor the iPhone; Vendors were scared to offer full access to the (GSM) hardware, and noone dared to deliver a native SDK. Openmoko was responsible for shaking the industry up a bit by providing all that.

Even though Openmoko released only two models, both which have been plagued by hardware bugs, they have been kick-starting a myriad of interesting free software and hardware projects. We're looking at the current state and future of the most interesting projects (such as SHR, freesmartphone.org, Aurora, QtMoko, ...) and how they apply to other devices. Last but not least we're giving an outline of the exciting new telephony hardware from Golden Delicious Computing.
