Overview
========

For our next generation framework we use vala as the own implementation language. As vala is a programming language which processes very fast and adds new feature very often (which might break backward compatiblity) we maintain an own branch of the vala compiler. This branch contains some additional patches we need to build the FSO framework.

Branch layout
=============

Currently we have two relevant branches for FSO in our vala git repository:

-   master: Current from FSO supported version of vala with additional patches
-   upstream/master: Tracks Vala's upstream master branch (http://git.gnome.org/browse/vala/)
