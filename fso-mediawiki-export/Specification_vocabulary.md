### Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN)

M
-

### Man-Machine Interface (MMI)


An interface between user and device. Also known as user interface (UI).

### Mobile Equipment (ME)


"""The Mobile Equipment is functionally divided into several entities, i.e.one or more Mobile Terminations (MT) and one or more Terminal Equipments (TE).""" (source: 3GPP TR 21.905)

### Mobile Station (MS)


"""A Mobile Station (MS) corresponds to a User Equipment (UE). See 3GPP TS 24.002.""" (source: 3GPP TR 21.905)

### Mobile Termination (MT)


"""The Mobile Termination is the component of the Mobile Equipment (ME) which supports functions specific to management of the PLMN access interface (3GPP or non-3GPP). The MT is realized as a single functional entity.""" (source: 3GPP TR 21.905)

T
-

### Terminal Adaptor (TA)


The system between TE and MT (see 3GPP TS 27.007)

### Terminal Equipment (TE)


"""Equipment that provides the functions necessary for the operation of the access protocols by the user. A functional group on the user side of a user-network interface (source: ITU-T I.112).""" (source: 3GPP TR 21.905)

U
-

### User Equipment (UE)


"""User Equipment (UE): Allows a user access to network services. For the purpose of 3GPP specifications the interface between the UE and the network is the radio interface. A User Equipment can be subdivided into a number of domains, the domains being separated by reference points. Currently the User Equipment is subdivided into the UICC domain and the ME Domain. The ME Domain can further be subdivided into one or more Mobile Termination (MT) and Terminal Equipment (TE) components showing the connectivity between multiple functional groups.

In the context of Fixed Broadband Access to IMS, TISPAN defines the term UE in ETSI TR180 000 [5].""" (source: 3GPP TR 21.905)

### UICC


"""a physically secure device, an IC card (or 'smart card'), that can be inserted and removed from the terminal equipment. It may contain one or more applications. One of the applications may be a USIM.""" (source: 3GPP TR 21.905)
