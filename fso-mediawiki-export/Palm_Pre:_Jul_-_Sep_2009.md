This page may be of historical interest; for current activity, see [Palm Pre: Jan 2010 - ?](/Palm_Pre:_Jan_2010_-_? "wikilink")

Free the Pre
============

This page is to document efforts to liberate the Palm Pre from nonfree software, such as the LunaSysMgr GUI / Windowing System.

We would prefer a GNU/Linux (GPL / Mostly GPL except when they choose to ignore their own license for device driver binary blobs) rather than an Android/Linux ([Apache](http://source.android.com/license) / Mostly GPL except when they choose to ignore their own license for device driver binary blobs) port.

Also Android is based on Java, which might be good to avoid if possible: [Considerations on Patents that Read on Language Infrastructure](http://www.softwarefreedom.org/blog/2009/jun/29/language-patents/), and perhaps even still [Free But Shackled - The Java Trap](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/java-trap.html) as I've heard parts of the Android SDK still require Sun Java 1.5.

Community Organizing
