This is initially to make an introspection in the Palm Pre 2 Hardware and libs to find the differences from the first Pre.

-edit-

It is more relevant to put it on [WebOS-internal's wiki](http://www.webos-internals.org/wiki/PalmPre2HardwareAndDriversInformations)

As it seems that they only changed the CPU, the case and put a glassy display, It should not be very different from for the first Pre.
