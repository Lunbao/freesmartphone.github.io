# Contribute

There are many ways to contribute to this initiative: Please communicate with us on the mailing lists, send us pull requests for any of the subproject, or just tell us your success story adopting freesmartphone.org.

## Mailing list

Our mailing list is fso at openphoenux.org, gracefully hosted by the guys from the [OpenPhoenux](http://www.openphoenux.org) project. You can join and/or find the new (post 2014) archives at [lists.openphoenux.org](http://lists.openphoenux.org/mailman/listinfo/fso).

I have a dump of the old archives, which I'm going to upload soon.

## Source code

The source code for this site and all of the FSO subprojects is at [github/freesmartphone](https://github.com/freesmartphone). We have an organization account – feel free to send us your username, if you want to join.

## IRC

A life chat is on [freenode.net:6667](http://www.freenode.net) – for now we are (ab)using the **#openmoko-cdevel** channel. Depending on the project focus and the amount of traffic, we may also use **#freesmartphone.org** in the future.
